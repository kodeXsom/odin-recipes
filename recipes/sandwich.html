    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From TikTok-famous grinder salad sandwiches to old-school N’awlins-style Muffalettas, the range and influence of Italian sandwiches is vast and inspiring. After all, there’s nothing quite like a stack of tasty deli meats and cheeses drenched in olive oil, salt, piquant peppers, and pillowy bread. And if you prefer steaming hot, toasted sandwiches, there’s more than a few saucy, cheesy options on this list—including at least one that's Grandma-approved. Go on and give one (or several) of these tasty Italian sandwich recipes a try.</p>
